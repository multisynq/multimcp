## Phase Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: 2024-07-25
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Tasks Completed:
- [x] **MetaMCP Repository Setup**
  - Cloned MetaMCP to `/home/will/git/0croquet/multimcp`
  - Reviewed existing architecture and capabilities
  - Understood endpoint routing and configuration patterns

- [x] **Docker Configuration**
  - Modified `Dockerfile` to include `@context7/mcp-server`
  - Updated container build process for Context7 integration
  - Verified npm package installation works correctly

- [x] **Environment Configuration**
  - Removed Context7 API key dependencies (runs locally)
  - Updated `docker-compose.yml` for proper environment setup
  - Created clean `.env` configuration

#### Key Decisions:
- **Decision**: Use local Context7 MCP server instead of external API
- **Rationale**: Better performance, fewer dependencies, simpler deployment

### ✅ Phase 2: Core MultiSynq Integration (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: 2024-07-25
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Tasks Completed:
- [x] **Configuration Module** (`config.ts`)
  - Defined STDIO-based MCP server configuration
  - Pre-configured Context7 library ID as `/multisynq/docs`
  - Set up root namespace and endpoint configurations
  - Ensured public access (no authentication required)

- [x] **Initialization Service** (`init.ts`)
  - Automatic server/namespace/endpoint creation on startup
  - Database integration with proper repository usage
  - Error handling and graceful degradation
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

- [x] **Root Endpoint Configuration**
  - Changed from nested paths to root endpoints
  - Configured endpoints: `/sse`, `/mcp`, `/api`
  - Public access without authentication
  - Integration with MetaMCP routing system

- [x] **Startup Integration**
  - Added initialization to MetaMCP startup sequence
  - Proper error handling to prevent startup failures
  - Logging and status reporting

#### Key Decisions:
- **Decision**: Use root endpoints instead of `/metamcp/multisynq/`
- **Rationale**: Simpler URLs for developers, better UX
- **Decision**: Public access without authentication  
- **Rationale**: Zero-friction developer experience
